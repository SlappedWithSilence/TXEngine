	- Jhio

		- Has thick, armor-like scales that cover lay on top of a potent layer of insulating fat
		- Round in appearence. Two arms, two legs, and a powerful tail
		- Not very intelligent, but have great memory.
		- Average life span is 40-50 years due to environmental hazards in their homeland, though many can live to be as long as 200 if they are lucky.
		- Jhio's great memory makes them incredible translators. Unfortunately the Jhio can't stay in warm climates for long as their internal insulation will make them overheat. As such, for very important inter-species communication, they often will travel to guarded outposts on the Jhio's home territory. The Jhio perform this service, for a cost: food, wood, and even books.
		- The Jhio are the continent's history keepers. Within the Jhio, there are many factions. Each records different types of history, as they all disagree as to what matters most in a historical record. Ironically, this ends up producing much more accurate and objective historical records in aggregate. All together, the Jhio have dutifully archived more than 10,000 years of continental history.

		- Skin is tinged a dark green and grey
		- Similar life-spans to humans
		- Can't use magic
		- Have enhanced sexual characteristics throughout their entire population, both male and female.
		- A side effect of the enhanced sexual characteristics is that secondary characteristics, such as long hair for females, and strong bodys for males, are also exagerated. The Mehkal are fierece warriors that are difficult to subjugate.
		- Were persecuted by humans long ago. Now the Mehkal live in solitude, only accepting visitors for temporary lodging in their "service" towns. It is unknown what the Mehkal civilization is like outside of these towns.
		- Long, long ago the Mehkal were attacked by a human nation that tried to force them into sexual slavery
		- Shrewd merchants who engage in trade using a small and exclusive group of human proxies. These humans are thought to be under some sort of Mehkal duress, though the details are entirely unknown to outsiders.
		- Lives in a variety of cities in the west of the continent.

	- O'h-Ra
		- A near-extinct race of arcanic masters. There are few known throughout the world, though rumors of a massive O'h-Ra city embedded deep within the earth have been gaining traction in recent years.
		- Very tall, their slim bodies extending nearly 8.5 feet in hight.
		- Humanoid
		- Pitch black skin, diamond-like heads, sharp angular eyes, and highly-jointed extremeties
		- No mouth, but three nose-holes near the center of the head
		- Hunched backs with skinny, bent legs.
		- Move silently
		- Near-impossible to see at night
		- Intelligent, very unfriendly
		- Can communicated through ultrasonic vibrations via a special organ embedded in their chest
		- Not much is known of their biology, except that O'h-Ra corpses turn to obsidian within a couple years after their death
		- The last band of adventurers to seek out a known O'h-Ra was found dismembered, and cut in half... vertically. They were each smiling.
		- The O'h-Ra were a war-faring nation before their massive decline in population
		- An indivual O'h-Ra is capable of weilding magic strong enough to obliterate an entire platoon of well-trained soldiers. There isn't much a human can do against a 30-foot-wide ball of fire.


Major Historical Events

- Year 0: The Jhio unify as a nation and begin a policy of recording everything they see as a part of a dare between two Council-Jhios. In the end, everyone both won.

- Year 304: The Jhio make contact with a Drejlahem explorer, known as He Who Finds. This Derjlahem spends the entire winter in the Jhio capitol, slowly teaching the foremost Jhio scholars (Kaokin's younger brothers, Jaihak and Oloo) how to speak Drejla, the native Drejlahemian tongue.

- Year 450: A band of Mehkal refuges flee uniwttingly into Jhio terretory during a terrible storm. Oddly enough, the Jhio find these strangers very attractive and take them in until the blizzard passes. During this time, the Jhio learn several Mehkal words and phrases, as well as some Human ones, but they ultimately fail to get much out of the traumatized and weathered refugees.

- Year 523: Strange vessels appear in the eastern sea within the Jhio territory. The Jhio, unsure as to what this means, set out meager offerings of peace along the beach where the vessels were sighted. Contact with these mysterous sailors was never made, though several of the offerings went missing over night.

- Year 808: Humans, hearing of the Jhio and their vast knowlege, make an expedition out to a known outpost discovered many years earlier by a group of Mehkal. They are surprised to hear the the Jhio declare to them "Oi, We hear stop! We hear stop!" as they arrived. After the Humans finished teaching their language to the Jhio a number of months later, it was discovered that the Jhio simply were trying to say "Hello, we can't understand you". The humans, learning of the Mehkal arrivals many hundreds of years ago set off on another journey to locate any descendants of that raggedy band.

- Year 810: The Human explorers who left the Jhio in search of a Mehkal settlement succeed. They are never heard of again.

- Year 1009: The 42 Human nation-states unify after a 20-year war. They vow to never set the sparks of war again, and were pretty good at keeping their promise. Tod II was an exception to this rule, and Humans have an unspoken agreement amongst eachother to pretend he never existed.

- Year 1079: The Humans defuse a war between two Frei nations who were threatening to disrupt their only supply of high-quality leather. After the Humans realized that they were pretty good peace-brokers, this job was formally self-appointed by the Human high-council. Tod II was officially condemned as a jerk and state emissaries were sent out to all nearby nations to extend gestures of good will.

- Year 1500: The Drejlahem, annoyed with how much the son of He Who Finds bragged about his late father, send out two more explorers to trade with foriegn lands. The first makes the first Drejlahemian contact with the Mehkal, while the second meets with both the Frei and the Humans. The humans barter half a ton of skrei backon (a fatty fried meat snack) for six ingots of medium-tier mana-ore. The Drejlahemian explorer carrierd all 1000 pounds of skrei backon on his back for the entirety of his 200-mile journey home. Thus began the Backon-Mana Ingot Exchange Era that yeilded the Humans a massive amount of wealth and prosperity for all 600 years that it lasted.

- Year 2129: The end of the Backon-Mana Ingot Exchange Era. After a human accidentally injured a Drejlahemian, the species retreated into their territory for many hundreds of years, cutting off all trade with the rest of the continent. This inadvertently led to a massive over-supply of skrei backon, leading to The Great Waste: a brief period, lasting only until Year 2133, where Humans had to bury hundreds of tons of skrei backon that no longer had any buyers.
