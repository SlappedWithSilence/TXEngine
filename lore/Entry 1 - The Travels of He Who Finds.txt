Year 303, Hedraim

"You must not be serious" said Heidja. "Our ancestors tended this land, and we do not stray from it".

"I am not my forefathers" said Kautja, slowly shaking his head, his eyes narrowing in frustration.

"Even if that is so, you are needed here. Us Drejlahem are not large in number. We must persevere within our borders!".

The two towering creatures stood, less than three feet apart. The narrow mountain path on which they stood was becoming obscured by snowfall. 

"I will not argue with you further, Heidja. My mind in settled, I must go forth and explore our world".

Heidja took a step back, her substantial, round feet leaving deep depressions in the now-thick snow.

"If you must go, you must. But know this: I, as an elder Drejlahemian, will not support you".

Kautja turned away from Heidja and began trudging down the path, away from the town.

"It is as you say!" Boomed Kautja, his siloughette fading into the sleet-laden wind. "I will return with new knowlege!".
